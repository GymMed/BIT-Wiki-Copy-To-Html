        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>Richard Tiffany Gere was born in <a href="">Philadelphia</a> on August 31, 1949,<a href=""><sup>[4]</sup></a> the eldest son and second child 
            of housewife Doris Ann (<a href="">née</a> Tiffany; 1924–2016) and <a href="">NMIC</a> insurance agent Homer George Gere (1922-2023).
            <a href=""><sup>[5][6]</sup></a> His father originally intended to become a <a href="">minister.<sup>[7]</sup></a> Gere was raised 
            <a href="">Methodist<sup>[8][9]</sup></a> in <a href="">Syracuse, New York.<sup>[10]</sup></a> His paternal great-grandfather, George 
            Lane Gere (1848–1932), changed the spelling of his surname from "Geer". One of his ancestors, also named George, was an Englishman who 
            came from <a href="">Heavitree</a> and settled in the <a href="">Connecticut Colony</a> in 1638.<a href=""><sup>[11]</sup></a> Both of 
            Gere's parents were <a><i>Mayflower</i></a> descendants; his ancestors include <a href="">Pilgrims</a> such as <a href="">John Billington</a>, 
            <a href="">William Brewster</a>, <a href="">Francis Eaton</a>, <a href="">Francis Cooke</a>, <a href="">Degory Priest</a>, 
            <a href="">George Soule</a> and <a href="">Richard Warren</a>.<a href=""><sup>[12]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1967, he graduated from <a href="">North Syracuse Central High School</a>, where he excelled at gymnastics and music and played 
            the trumpet.<a href=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> He attended the <a href="">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> on a gymnastics scholarship, 
            studying philosophy; after two years, he left and did not graduate.<a href=""><sup>[7][13]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
            Gere first worked professionally at the <a href="">Seattle Repertory Theatre</a> and the <a href="">Provincetown Playhouse</a> on Cape 
            Cod in 1969, where he starred in <a href=""><i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</i></a>. His first major acting role was in the 
            original London stage version of <a href=""><i>Grease</i></a>, in 1973.<a href=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> He was one of the first notable 
            Hollywood actors to play a homosexual character, starring as a <a href="">gay Holocaust victim</a> in the 1979 <a href="">Broadway</a> 
            production of <a href=""><i>Bent</i></a>, for which he earned a <a href="">Theatre World Award.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Gere began appearing in <a href="">Hollywood</a> films in the mid-1970s. Originally cast in a starring role in 
            <a href=""><i>The Lords of Flatbush</i></a> (1974), he was replaced after fighting with his co-star <a href="">Sylvester Stallone</a>. 
            He played a small but memorable part in <a href=""><i>Looking for Mr. Goodbar</i></a> (1977) and starred in director 
            <a href="">Terrence Malick</a>'s well-reviewed drama <a href=""><i>Days of Heaven</i></a> (1978).<a href=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> 
            The crime drama <a href=""><i>American Gigolo</i></a> (1980) significantly boosted his profile and the romantic drama 
            <a href=""><i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i></a> (1982) (co-starring <a href="">Debra Winger</a>) cemented Gere's ascent to stardom, 
            grossing almost $130 million<a href=""><sup>[14]</sup></a> and winning two <a href="">Academy Awards</a> out of six nominations;
            <a href=""><sup>[15]</sup></a> Gere himself received his first <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination.<a href=""><sup>[16]</sup></a> 
            For the remainder of the 1980s, Gere appeared in films of varying critical and commercial reception.<a href=""><sup>[17][18]</sup></a> 
            His career rebounded with the releases of <a href=""><i>Internal Affairs</i></a> (1990) and <a href=""><i>Pretty Woman</i></a> (1990), 
            the latter of which earned him his second <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination.<a href=""><sup>[19]</sup></a> 
            The 1990s saw Gere star in successful films including <a href=""><i>Sommersby</i></a> (1993) (opposite <a href="">Jodie Foster</a>), 
            <a href=""><i>Primal Fear</i></a> (1996) and <a href=""><i>Runaway Bride</i></a> (1999) (which reunited him with his 
            <i>Pretty Woman</i> co-star <a href="">Julia Roberts</a>).<a href=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> He also took a leading role in the action 
            thriller <a href="">The Jackal</a> (1997), playing former IRA militant Declan Mulqueen; Gere affected an Irish accent for the role.
            <a href=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Gere was named <a href=""><i>People</i></a> magazine's "<a href="">Sexiest Man Alive</a>" in 1999. Not long thereafter, all in 
            the same year, he appeared in the hit films <a href=""><i>The Mothman Prophecies</i></a> (2002), <a href=""><i>Unfaithful</i></a> 
            (2002) and the <a href="">Academy Award</a>-winning <a href="">musical film adaptation</a> <a href=""><i>Chicago</i></a> (2002),
            <a href=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> for which he won his first <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a>. Gere's <a href="">ballroom dancing</a> 
            drama <a href=""><i>Shall We Dance?</i></a> (2004) was also a solid performer that grossed $170 million worldwide.
            <a href=""><sup>[21]</sup></a> His next film, the <a href="">book-to-screen adaptation</a> <a href=""><i>Bee Season</i></a> 
            (2005), was a commercial failure.<a href=""><sup>[22]</sup></a> Gere went on to co-star with <a href="">Jesse Eisenberg</a> 
            and <a href="">Terrence Howard</a> in <a href=""><i>The Hunting Party</i></a> (2007), a thriller in which he played a journalist in 
            <a href="">Bosnia</a>. He next appeared with <a href="">Christian Bale</a>, <a href="">Heath Ledger</a> and <a href="">Cate Blanchett</a> 
            in <a href="">Todd Haynes</a>' semi-biographical film about <a href="">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href=""><i>I'm Not There</i></a> (2007); 
            Gere was one of six actors to portray a variation of Dylan. He co-starred with <a href="">Diane Lane</a> in the romantic drama 
            <a href=""><i>Nights in Rodanthe</i></a> (2008). The film was widely panned by critics<a href=""><sup>[23]</sup></a> (making #74 on 
            <i>The Times</i> Worst Films of 2008 list),<a href=""><sup>[24]</sup></a> but grossed over $84 million worldwide.
            <a href=""><sup>[25]</sup></a> The film is his most recent to have been produced entirely by a <a href="">major film studio</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gere has expressed a belief that his politics regarding China, an important financial resource for major Hollywood studios, 
            have made him <a href="">unwelcome within Hollywood</a>.<a href=""><sup>[26]</sup></a> He embraced his apparent exile from 
            Hollywood and instead appeared in independent films that garnered some of the best reviews of his career.<a href=""><sup>[18]</sup></a> 
            He was notably singled out for portraying businessman Robert Miller in <a href=""><i>Arbitrage</i></a> (2012), earning his fourth 
            <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination. Among many positive reviews,<a href=""><sup>[27]</sup></a> <a href="">Peter Travers</a> 
            of <a href=""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a> cited Gere's performance as "too good to ignore" and "an implosive tour de force".
            <a href=""><sup>[28]</sup></a> <a href="">Lou Lumenick</a> of the <a href=""><i>New York Post</i></a> further wrote that he "gives 
            the best performance of his career".<a href=""><sup>[29]</sup></a> Also in 2012, he received the Golden Starfish Award for Lifetime 
            Achievement from the <a href="">Hamptons International Film Festival</a> and the Career Achievement Award from the 
            <a href="">Hollywood Film Awards</a>.<a href=""><sup>[30][31]</sup></a> He had earlier received an award from the 
            <a href="">34th Cairo International Film Festival</a> in December 2010.<a href=""><sup>[32]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Gere made a notable departure from his traditional screen persona with <a href="">Joseph Cedar</a>'s political drama 
            <a href=""><i>Norman</i></a> (2016). The film saw him portray Norman Oppenheimer, a small-time Jewish <a href="">fixer</a>. 
            Gere himself described the character as an embodiment of the "sides of us we know are annoying and needy".<a href=""><sup>[33]</sup></a> 
            His portrayal of Oppenheimer was called "consistently, completely fascinating" by <a href="">RogerEbert.com</a>
            <a href=""><sup>[34]</sup></a> and was singled out as a worthy <a href="">Academy Award</a> contender by 
            <a href=""><i>Variety</i></a>.<a href=""><sup>[35]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Gere is an accomplished musician, composing and performing the <i>Pretty Woman</i> piano theme and a guitar solo in 
            <i>Runaway Bride</i>. He learned tap dance for his role as lawyer Billy Flynn in <i>Chicago</i>,<a href=""><sup>[36]</sup></a> 
            and karate for <i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i>.<a href=""><sup>[37]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited Gere as one of the best actors never to have received an 
            <a href="">Academy Award</a> nomination.<a href=""><sup>[38][39]</sup></a>
